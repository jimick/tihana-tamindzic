Believes nothing is stopping us from using our full potential or from being what we want to be except ourselves, so before challenging others she constantly creates new ones for herself. At the moment she is working on finishing a running marathon. Cheerful and inquisitive, Tihana explains that using coaching and trainings she enjoys creating a supportive surrounding and a valuable opportunity for everyone to take away their own victory. To be the best version of themselves. As a trainer and as a coach, she feels best upon seeing an empowered and radiant client. Tihana lives up to the Latin saying _Mens sana in corpora sano_ and that is why she will always join you for a run, a hike, a ballgame or simply laugh her pants off with you wherever.

Working as an English and French **teacher**, she put into practice all the theoretical knowledge on didactics, methodics and pedagogy; took a couple of years in Holland to educate herself further on being a coach and **transformational trainer**; cooperated and held numerous international personal development and coaching trainings;  together with her colleagues founded Syncro and Synergy Croatia, an NGO; proud to have been an Outward Bound instructor.

As a Croatian Association for Coaching **coach**, she believes that we already know everything we need to know in order to recreate the things we want. She sees coaching as a process that supports:  verbalizing that knowledge, taking a peek at it from an overlooked  perspective and taking control over the paintbrush of your masterpiece. Coach asks the question, client finds (remembers) the answer.

Becoming an **NLP master**, she perfected her applied psychology approach, paying special interest in implementing the excellence modeling discipline in the fast business world of leaders and managers. Three years of working in Allianz Zagreb insurance company gave her the required feedback. Applied NLP in sales, organisation and management proved to be helpful since it started answering the question preoccupying many people in business: what is the difference that makes the difference in successful and satifsied people?

I finished IV. Language grammar school and Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb which gave me a diploma in English and French language and literature. Drawn by the thought of teaching,  because of a direct impact into young people modeling and education, through the teacher role I had a chance to work in elementary schools, high schools and foreign language schools. The private tutoring lessons I gave never consisted solely from grammar improvement or conversational skills proficiency. They were regularly spiced up with a bit of personal development, so that, money aside, my reward was also the enthusiasm and satisfaction of a client.

 ### Early on I discovered that education was a process not a goal.
 
I was always interested in the way people function. Why is it they do the things they do, why they do not change the patterns leading nowhere. Why the hell don`t they? How come my truth differs from yours? What are beliefs, where do they come from and why are they sometimes limiting? So I dipped into the field of psychology and kept myself busy by reading, exploring and taking action.

My personal development deserved time, so I decided to invest in it up to three years. I spent most of that time in Holland, doing international personal development trainings with the [Synergy Group](http://www.s-gr.com). Started as a participant and ended up as an Assistant. I also completed the NLP coaching training led by the organization [Its all About Doing](http://www.itsallaboutdoing.nl). Coaching drew me because I found it practical: if you want something, act upon it and get results. You are the creator. It couldn’t be any simpler. Putting my coaching skills immediately into practice, I now enjoy the support of many satisfied clients in Croatia and abroad. A part of the  [Croatian Association for Coaching](http://www.hr-coaching.hr), my speciality is transformational, that is ontological coaching. The love for ontology came from the dedication and love of my now late mentor, the experienced ontological coach from the South African Republic, [Pat Grove](www.trans4tech.wordpress.com/).

### I am practical and result oriented.

Unfortunately I was not blessed with the knowledge of Dutch but with the desire to offer the possibility of such personal development to Croatia, so together with my colleagues I founded [Synergy Croatia](http://www.synergy-croatia.com), a personal development NGO focusing on non formal education and international cooperation striving to support and encourage the quality of life and empowering youth for an active and responsible living. It is a part of the International Synergy Group with which it shares basic values and the vision of the world that works for everybody. It gathers around 35 organizations from all over the world. Synergy Croatia so far inspired many participants that continued improving and building it. The original idea of spreading development and empowerment through personal transformation grew within me and my colleagues so we went on founding [Syncro](http://www.syncro.hr), now a training center focusing on Practicing Coaching Training and Syncro Training. My colleagues continued leading Syncro.

Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
It is our light not our darkness that frightens us most. 
We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? <small>Marianne Wiliamson</small>

### I believe people are a limitless possibility.

I cherish the days I actively fulfilled the role of an [Outward Bound](http://www.outwardbound.hr) Instructor, a school dedicated to experiential learning in nature. The great mountain Velebit and the Croatian coast served as a classroom, hiking, rock climbing, kayaking and life in untouched nature as a method, and various problem solving, group and coaching activities as a means of personal transformation and discovering dormant strength and will. The mission of Outward Bound is making participants realize their own limits, then overcoming them and leading by example. One of its basic principles is nicely described in Admiral Hopper`s quote: "A ship in port is safe, but that's not what ships are built for."

The power of neurolinguistic programming leaves a powerful mark on my way of reazoning because of its capability to explain personal development, discover the trigger causing the problem and install a solution, all with mathematical precision. NLP is definitely a strong pattern of my work. I am especially caught by the magic of language that meta and Milton model offer. Considering the linguistical background I hold, I went further into the topic and discovered how it makes a big difference how we say the things we think and how it is all connected to our emotional and physical state, and consequently our future. An approach similar to the ontological one. The patient Gordana Kastrapeli taught me Practitioner skills while I became a Master with the help of Sasha Tenodi.

It was a pleasure translating Be Your Better Self, Amazon bestseller written by Sasha Tenodi, which gives pragmatic guidelines towards personal transformation through applied psychology, NLP methods and the author`s life experience.

For almost three years I was a part of Allianz as a sales, communication and presentation skills trainer. The sales business, this world being filled with imperative quick decision making, gave a new dimension to my comprehension of personal transformation. Together with participants, we chiseled the power of nonverbal communication, effective time management, the art of asking questions and oral expression, leadership, dynamic presentations, individual motivation, needs, habits and goals.

I feed my adventure spirit and desire for action with travel and physical activity. Running, trekking, cycling, boxing. There is an unbreakable and mutually dependant bond between the body, mind/language and emotion. A lot of wisdom for us to collect from acknowledging our body. Physical activities show us, in the most fundamental way, the limitations hidden within us, the thing we are build from and remind us of our dreams.

It is a very mean and nasty place and it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward. How much you can take, and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Now, if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hit, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you are because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you. You're better than that! <small>Rocky Balboa</small>
