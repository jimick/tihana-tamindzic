Transformation.

Cute word, isn`t it?

Sounds good, I will have three, you`re thinking to yourself.

It`s a deal. Under one condition. That you mean what you say and you say what you mean.

Because a call for transformation is similar to a wakeup call, where you see your world with new, rested eyes. Only one thing...we cannot awaken a person pretending to be asleep.


You agree with me?
Excellent!


Transformation is a process resulting in an irretrievably new original. It consists much more than mere addition and subtraction. An original adds a new pair of shoes and a purse, thinking that now it is different. But, is it?

How many times it happened that you did something differently, saying this is it, finally from now on things will go uphill. For example, you enrolled in a gym, read a book, assertively stated your problem on the department meeting, decided the children are going to bed 9 pm the latest. The motivation for a change is at its peak in the beginning, because you altered your old routine. You did something new, something different. Congratulations are in order! However, that does not mean that you will lose weight because you provided the gym with a certain amount of money, that does not mean that you are applying the red book theories, that you are going to remain assertive when a colleague pushes a nerve and that you are going to be consistent and strong enough for your children to go to bed at the arranged time every single night.

Or you decided to get something new, thinking that finally your luck is about to change the moment you obtain that diploma, hand in that resignation, pay that loan or move abroad. Nothing is stopping you, is it? Just that one little thing is standing between you and happiness, right? Wrong. After the first enthusiasm surge of doing something out of your routine calms down, you realize that you are preoccupied with same problems even though you are living in Miami, own a cutting edge cell phone, have a better payed job (diploma). Yes, the demons that were haunting you back then are somehow still here.

You better have a pretty good relationship with yourself for one simple reason. You are 24/7 with this person. Hanging around with that little voice inside your head that does not seem to subdue even next to the loudest speaker. The voice that can become your best friend or worse enemy. It undoubtedly states you do not have to **HAVE** something (cell phone, new job, another state) or **DO** something (work out, read, make the children go to bed) in order for you to **BE**. Happy, patient, serene, brave, sexy, smart, zen, whatever. 

If sometimes you feel like Sisyphus and think there must be something wrong to what you are doing, relax. Everything you are up to is perfectly fine, you just need to correct the chronology of it. **First you decide to BE a certain thing and all the rest happens.** First I decide to be successful and working (DO) out of that energy and attitude, the results start coming in (HAVE). First I define Who I want to be and allow it to further create my circumstances, because it is the only way I am not going to settle for less, am I?

Transformation goes much deeper into the Being, the little never-ending voice, into our interwoven values and beliefs into all the things that constitute our Truth. We just have to be able to hear it and make a distinction between all the other voices we hear inside: mother, grandmother, teacher, priest, America, Christianity, vegetarianism, etc. To listen to the right voice equals getting the answer to the dreaded question: what do I want? Once you reach a breakthrough in this area, everything that happens from this moment on carries a different tune. A melody of Who you really are.

Somehow all we want is to be free, blind to the fact that we are prisoners of our own limiting beliefs and thoughts. If we are experiencing a headache, taking pills will solve our problem only for a while. Why? Because we have eliminated just the consequence of our troubles. The cause of the ache lies most probably in a current *problem*.  Unless we solve the cause, the problem will keep returning, will it not?


There you go.
